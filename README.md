# Facial Recognition in Examination using Neural Network and Transfer Learning
To train a pre-trained model to enhance the facial recognition performances. 

## Overview
Our research is to overcome the challenges that often happens during examination i.e Impersonation. With thousands of students on board, no examiner can address identity, cheating, and privacy concerns efficiently at the same time. In the era of artificial intelligence and machine learning, biometric solutions seem to be the most suitable go-to, and there are good reasons for it. With the advent of machine driven models we developed a model that is highly efficient using ensembled technique to increase the performance of face recognition which can serve multiple purposes — from registering students to the exam and confirming their identity to securing their presence during the test.


## What is Face Recognition System?
A facial recognition system is a technology potentially capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces.

## What is Neural Network and Transfer Learning?
A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.

<b>Brief Overview of Transfer Learning</b> <br>
Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for a new task or domain. The idea is to leverage the knowledge acquired by the pre-trained model on a large dataset and apply it to a related task with a smaller dataset. By doing so, we can benefit from the general features and patterns learned by the pre-trained model, saving time and computational resources.

## Development
This project was built using python and the frontend using React - Typescript
